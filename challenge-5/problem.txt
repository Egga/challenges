# Challenge #5: Refactor this code

## Instructions

Refactor the code as much as you can. The code is located in the "code" folder and is available in multiple programming languages; pick the one you know best. 

Change the code in place. When done, make a pull request with the title "challenge 5".

The code implements a naive TicTacToe game. The moves are introduced by the two users from the console. The board is considered to be 3x3 and the move is represented as an integer from 1 to 9. Each number represents a place on the board, going from left to right and top to bottom, like this:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

After all the moves are introduced, the program decides the winner.

## Scoring

You get points for: increased readability, reduced duplication and following SOLID principles. You will be penalized if you change the behavior of the code (this includes any bugs you might find).

Special note for the c version: you are allowed to change it to c++ if you think you can obtain better results.

You will get:

* 0 points if no pull request 
* 1 point if you make a pull request even if there's no solution
* 2-30 points if you make a pull request with a partial or complete solution
