Welcome to the I TAKE Unconference 2015 Contest!

# About the Contest

The best reward for a software craftsman is to learn new things. Mozaic Works, the I TAKE Unconference organizers, want to create this opportunity for you every year. This contest is a set of challenges that will put your skills to the test. Do you know how to test systems? Can you point coding issues? Are you open to learning from other people? And, best of all, can you safely clean up existing code and improve its design? These are all core developer skills nowadays, and you'll greatly benefit from mastering them. This is just one opportunity to do so.

We hope that you will enjoy this contest. Oh, we almost forgot: the person who has the most points wins a gadget. That's a small reward compared to the learning, but we're sure it helps :).

Enjoy!
