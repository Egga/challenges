Welcome to the I TAKE Unconference 2015 Contest!

# About the Contest

The best reward for a software craftsman is to learn new things. Mozaic Works, the I TAKE Unconference organizers, want to create this opportunity for you every year. This contest is a set of challenges that will put your skills to the test. Do you know how to test systems? Can you point coding issues? Are you open to learning from other people? And, best of all, can you safely clean up existing code and improve its design? These are all core developer skills nowadays, and you'll greatly benefit from mastering them. This is just one opportunity to do so.

We hope that you will enjoy this contest. Oh, we almost forgot: the person who has the most points wins a gadget. That's a small reward compared to the learning, but we're sure it helps :).

Enjoy!

# How it Works

All you have to do to register is to fork this repository. Once you've finished a challenge, make a pull request with a title stating the challenge number.

If you want to improve a solution you've already submitted, just make another pull request with the same title. We will take into account the last pull request before the deadline for each of the challenges.

You have time until May 29, 2 pm. Any pull request done after this time will not be taken into account.

# Challenges

Show your craftsman skills in a set of short challenges and gather up to 100 points. The person with most points wins a gadget.

## 1. For 10 points: Tweet to @itakeunconf a photo with you pair programming with another attendee at the conference with the hashtag #itakecontest.

You get the points if we can see both of you on a keyboard in front of a screen with code on it.

To make sure that we get this right, please write down the url of the tweet in the solution.txt file in "challenge-1" folder. When done, make a pull request with the title "challenge 1". 

You will get:

* 0 points if no tweet and if no pull request
* 1 point if you make a pull request even if there's no tweet
* 10 points if you make a pull request and there is a tweet conforming the spec

## 2. For max 20 points: Write all the test names you would write 

The code is located in the "challenge-2" folder. Write down your solution in the file solution.txt.

When done, make a pull request with the title "challenge 2".

You will get:

* 0 points if no pull request 
* 1 point if you make a pull request even if there's no solution
* 2-20 points if you make a pull request with a partial or complete solution

## 3. For max 20 points:  Describe briefly all the bugs you find in this code

The code is located in the "challenge-3" folder. Write down your solution in the file solution.txt.

You get points for: clarity of description, completion of description (line of code where the bug is located, what is wrong and what should be the correct behavior) and the number of bugs found. Max 20 points

When done, make a pull request with the title "challenge 3".

You will get:

* 0 points if no pull request 
* 1 point if you make a pull request even if there's no solution
