# Challenge #2: Write all the test names you would write 

The code is located in the "code" folder. Write down your solution in the file solution.txt.

You get points for: clear test names, the number of behaviors covered. You will NOT get extra points if you actually write the tests.

When done, make a pull request with the title "challenge 2".

You will get:

* 0 points if no pull request 
* 1 point if you make a pull request even if there's no solution
* 2-20 points if you make a pull request with a partial or complete solution
