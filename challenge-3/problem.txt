# Challenge #3: Describe briefly all the bugs you find in this code

## Instructions

Describe briefly all the bugs you can find in the file "Tic.cs" from the "code" folder. The code is a naive implementation of the TicTacToe game.

For each bug you find, write down in the file "solution.txt" the following:

* description of current behavior
* description of expected behavior
* location of bug (method or line number)

When done, make a pull request with the title "challenge 3".

## Scoring

You get points for: clarity of description, completion of description and the number of bugs found.

You will get:

* 0 points if no pull request 
* 1 point if you make a pull request even if there's no solution
* 2-20 points if you make a pull request with a partial or complete solution
